	abstract = "Abstract: In the modern intensive care unit (ICU), the physiologic state of critically-ill patients is monitored through a diverse array of biosensors and laboratory measurements. The sheer volume of data that is collected has overwhelmed clinicians charged with assimilating and transforming the data into clinical hypotheses. The development of automated algorithms with vigilant monitoring and clinical decision-support capabilities would help to alleviate this ``information-overload'' challenge. The inherent noise and measurement error is an added level of complication to the real-time analysis and interpretation of medical data. One class of ``noise'' in medical data can be characterized by the absence or unavailability of a desired measurement. We have analyzed a large collection of clinical laboratory data (blood chemistry, blood gasses, complete blood counts) from over 600 ICU/CCU patients in the MIMIC II database. An analysis of the frequency of missing ! data values across patient records for each measurement was completed. Furthermore, we have developed a novel method to estimate the values of missing data by the use of a weighted K-nearest neighbors algorithm. We propose a weighting scheme that exploits the correlation between a ``missing'' dimension and available data values from other fields. We compare our technique with several popular missing value estimation techniques: principal components analysis, least squares estimation, mean imputation, and classical k-nearest neighbors. The mean standardized imputation error ranges from a minimum of 0.31 to a maximum, of 0.75 depending on the imputed dimension. The mean standardized imputation error over all dimensions is 0.45.",

We describe an evaluation protocol, procedures and performance measures suitable for assessing the robustness. An ST analyser is robust if its performance is not critically dependent on the variation of the noise content of input signals and on the choice of the database used for testing, and if its analysis parameters are not critically tuned to the database used for testing. The protocol to assess the robustness includes: (1) a noise stress test addressing the aspect of variation of input signals; (2) a bootstrap evaluation of algorithm performance addressing the aspect of distribution of input signals and (3) a sensitivity analysis addressing the aspect of variation of analyser's architecture parameters. An ST analyser is considered to be robust if the performance measurements obtained during these procedures remain above the predefined critical performance boundaries. We illustrate the use of the robustness protocol and robustness measures by a case study in which we assessed the robustness of our Karhunen-Lo{\`e}ve transform based ischaemic ST episode detection and quantification algorithm using the European Society of Cardiology ST-T database.",

	abstract = "Introduction The goal of this research project is to design and optimize a novel critical care alert and display (CCAD) system to assist decision support in the ICU using a massive temporal ICU patient research database [1]. The CCAD system will generate and display abnormal clinical values (Alerts) to the clinician through a user interface designed to allow for the efficient display of data. Background Patients admitted to ICUs are generally physiologically labile and require close monitoring, which results in the accumulation of a large amount of physiologic data. This accumulation of data can lead to an overload of information especially for young physicians caring for these patients. It is essential to have the ability to view and display this information in a concise manner to optimize patient care. Being able to review a large amount of chronological information in a short period of time might help the clinician better evaluate the state of a patient in the ICU. System Design The CCAD system was designed using the MIMIC II database which is a robust fully de-identified temporal ICU research database recorded from patients in the MICU, SICU, and CCU at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA [1]. The software program was written using C-sharp and compiled in the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET(tm) environment. The search engine accesses a set of relational databases and sends abnormal values to a Microsoft ACCESS(tm) database. The graphical user interface imports data from the ACCESS(tm) database and displays the abnormal values to the clinician. The clinician can then select an abnormal value and display the trend using a variety of different graphical tools. Results The search engine and the clinician GUI were both created off-line using the MIMIC II research database [1], which allowed clinicians to assist with the design of the system without altering real-time data or viewing protected health information. Histograms were generated to evaluate the frequency of abnormal values per ICU patient day. 2000 patients were selected from the MIMIC II database. Sixty different common ICU parameters were specified for analysis. For these parameters, there were a total of 56 abnormal values (alerts) generated per patient ICU day. For a 20 bed ICU, that would equate to 1127 total alerts per ICU patient day. When looking specifically at the complete blood count (CBC), 2.9 alerts were generated per ICU patient day.",

	abstract = "Background: Low tidal volume ventilation for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a well accepted concept. However, controversy persists regarding the optimal ventilator settings for ventilated patients without ARDS. This study tested the hypothesis that ventilator settings influence the development of new ARDS. MethodsRetrospective analysis of patients from the MIMIC-II database who were mechanically ventilated for [\&ge;] 48 hours between 2001 and 2005. Results: 2583 patients required greater than 48 hrs of ventilation. Of 789 patients who did not have ARDS at admission, 152 (19\%) went on to develop ARDS. Univariate analysis revealed high peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) (OR 1.53 per standard deviation, 95\% confidence interval 1.28 - 1.84), increasing PEEP (OR 1.35 per SD, 95\%CI 1.15 - 1.58) and tidal volume (OR 1.36 per SD, 95\%CI 1.12 - 1.64) to be significant risk factors. Major non-ventilator risk factors for ARDS included sepsis, low pH, elevated lactate, low albumin, transfusion of packed red blood cells, transfusion of plasma, high net fluid balance, and low respiratory compliance. Multivariable logistic regression showed that peak pressure (OR 1.31 per SD, 95\%CI 1.08 - 1.59), high net fluid balance (OR 1.3 per SD, 95\%CI 1.09 - 1.56), transfusion of plasma (OR 1.26 per SD, 95\%CI 1.07 - 1.49), sepsis (OR 1.57, 95\%CI 1.00 - 2.45) and tidal volume (OR 1.29 per SD, 95\%CI 1.02 - 1.52) were significantly associated with the development of ARDS. Conclusions: The associations between the development of ARDS and clinical interventions, including high airway pressures, high tidal volume, positive fluid balance and transfusion of blood products, suggests that ARDS may be a preventable complication in some cases.",

Thus, the comparison of proteins' structures, and their clustering accordingly to a given similarity measure, is at the core of today's biomedical research. In this paper, we show how an algorithmic information theory inspired Universal Similarity Metric (USM) can be used to calculate similarities between protein pairs. The method, besides being theoretically supported, is surprisingly simple to implement and computationally efficient.Results: Structural similarity between proteins in four different datasets was measured using the USM. The sample employed represented alpha, beta, alpha--beta, tim--barrel, globins and serpine protein types. The use of the proposed metric allows for a correct measurement of similarity and classification of the proteins in the four datasets.Availability: All the scripts and programs used for the preparation of this paper are available at http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/\~{}nxk/USM/protocol.html. In that web-page the reader will find a brief description on how to use the various scripts and programs.Supplementary information: The protein datasets used are collected in http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/\~{}nxk/USM/datasets.html.

@article{LiBMEO09,
	abstract = "BACKGROUND:Within the intensive care unit (ICU), arterial blood pressure (ABP) is typically recorded at different (and sometimes uneven) sampling frequencies, and from different sensors, and is often corrupted by different artifacts and noise which are often non-Gaussian, nonlinear and nonstationary. Extracting robust parameters from such signals, and providing confidences in the estimates is therefore difficult and requires an adaptive filtering approach which accounts for artifact types.METHODS:Using a large ICU database, and over 6000 hours of simultaneously acquired electrocardiogram (ECG) and ABP waveforms sampled at 125 Hz from a 437 patient subset, we documented six general types of ABP artifact. We describe a new ABP signal quality index (SQI), based upon the combination of two previously reported signal quality measures weighted together. One index measures morphological normality, and the other degradation due to noise. After extracting a 6084-hour subset of clean data using our SQI, we evaluated a new robust tracking algorithm for estimating blood pressure and heart rate (HR) based upon a Kalman Filter (KF) with an update sequence modified by the KF innovation sequence and the value of the SQI. In order to do this, we have created six novel models of different categories of artifacts that we have identified in our ABP waveform data. These artifact models were then injected into clean ABP waveforms in a controlled manner. Clinical blood pressure (systolic, mean and diastolic) estimates were then made from the ABP waveforms for both clean and corrupted data. The mean absolute error for systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressure was then calculated for different levels of artifact pollution to provide estimates of expected errors given a single value of the SQI.RESULTS:Our artifact models demonstrate that artifact types have differing effects on systolic, diastolic and mean ABP estimates. We show that, for most artifact types, diastolic ABP estimates are less noise-sensitive than mean ABP estimates, which in turn are more robust than systolic ABP estimates. We also show that our SQI can provide error bounds for both HR and ABP estimates.CONCLUSION:The KF/SQI-fusion method described in this article was shown to provide an accurate estimate of blood pressure and HR derived from the ABP waveform even in the presence of high levels of persistent noise and artifact, and during extreme bradycardia and tachycardia. Differences in error between artifact types, measurement sensors and the quality of the source signal can be factored into physiological estimation using an unbiased adaptive filter, signal innovation and signal quality measures.",

	abstract = "_Mallat's book is the undisputed reference in this field - it is the only one that covers the essential material in such breadth and depth. - Laurent Demanet, Stanford University\_ The new edition of this classic book gives all the major concepts, techniques and applications of sparse representation, reflecting the key role the subject plays in today's signal processing. The book clearly presents the standard representations with Fourier, wavelet and time-frequency transforms, and the construction of orthogonal bases with fast algorithms. The central concept of sparsity is explained and applied to signal compression, noise reduction, and inverse problems, while coverage is given to sparse representations in redundant dictionaries, super-resolution and compressive sensing applications. Features: * Balances presentation of the mathematics with applications to signal processing * Algorithms and numerical examples are implemented in WaveLab, a MATLAB toolbox * Companion website for instructors and selected solutions and code available for students New in this edition * Sparse signal representations in dictionaries * Compressive sensing, super-resolution and source separation * Geometric image processing with curvelets and bandlets * Wavelets for computer graphics with lifting on surfaces * Time-frequency audio processing and denoising * Image compression with JPEG-2000 * New and updated exercises **A Wavelet Tour of Signal Processing: The Sparse Way**, third edition, is an invaluable resource for researchers and R\&D engineers wishing to apply the theory in fields such as image processing, video processing and compression, bio-sensing, medical imaging, machine vision and communications engineering. Stephane Mallat is Professor in Applied Mathematics at {\'E}cole Polytechnique, Paris, France. From 1986 to 1996 he was a Professor at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University, and between 2001 and 2007, he co-founded and became CEO of an image processing semiconductor company. * Includes all the latest developments since the book was published in 1999, including its application to JPEG 2000 and MPEG-4 * Algorithms and numerical examples are implemented in Wavelab, a MATLAB toolbox * Balances presentation of the mathematics with applications to signal processing",

Numerous examples illustrate the techniques on actual time series. The many embedded exercises--with complete solutions provided in the Appendix--allow readers to use the book for self-guided study. Additional exercises can be used in a classroom setting. A Web site offers access to the time series and wavelets used in the book, as well as information on accessing software in S-Plus and other languages.

	abstract = "An important challenge in data mining is in identifying ``similar'' temporal patterns that may illuminate hidden information in a database of time series. We are actively engaged in the development of a temporal database of several thousand ICU patient records that contains time-varying physiologic measurements recorded over each patient's ICU stay. The discovery of multiparameter temporal patterns that are predictive of physiologic instability may aid clinicians in optimizing care for critically-ill patients.In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal similarity metric based on a transformation of time series data into an intuitive symbolic representation. The symbolic transform is based on a wavelet decomposition to characterize time series dynamics at multiple time scales. The symbolic transformation allows us to utilize classical information retrieval algorithms based on a vector-space model. Our algorithm is capable of assessing the similarity between multi-dim! ensional time series and is computationally efficient.We utilized our algorithm to identify similar physiologic patterns in hemodynamic time series from ICU patients. The results of this study demonstrate that similarities between different patient time series may have meaningful physiologic interpretations in the detection of impending hemodynamic deterioration. Thus, our framework may be of potential use in clinical decision-support systems. As a generalized time series similarity metric, the algorithms that are described have applications in several other domains as well.",

	abstract = "Detection and classification of ventricular complexes from the ECG is of considerable importance in Holter and critical care patient monitoring, being essential for the timely diagnosis of dangerous heart conditions. Accurate detection of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) is particularly important in relation to life-threatening arrhythmias. In this paper, we introduce a model-based dynamic algorithm for tracking the ECG characteristic waveforms using an extended Kalman filter. The algorithm can work on single or multiple leads. A ``polargram''{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\^a}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}{\^a}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¬''a polar representation of the signal{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\{\^a}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}{\^a}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¬''is introduced, which is constructed using the Bayesian estimations of the state variables. The polargram allows the specification of a polar envelope for normal rhythms. Moreover, we propose a novel measure of signal fidelity by monitoring the covariance matrix of the innovation signals throughout the filtering procedure. PVCs are detected by simultaneous tracking the signal fidelity and the polar envelope. Five databases, including 40 records from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, are used for differentiating normal, PVC, and other beats. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed method has an average detection accuracy of 99.10\%, aggregate sensitivity of 98.77\%, and aggregate positive predictivity of 97.47\%. Furthermore, the method is capable of 100\% accuracy for records that contain only PVCs and normal sinus beats. The results illustrate that the method can contribute to, and enhance the performance of clinical PVC detection.",

This manuscript provides an overview of this ``de-identification challenge'', describes the data and the annotation process, explains the evalua-tion metrics, discusses the nature of the systems that addressed the challenge, and analyzes the results of received system runs. The challenge data consisted of discharge summaries drawn from the Partners Healthcare system. Authors prepared this data for the challenge by replacing authentic PHI with synthe-sized surrogates. To focus the challenge on non-dictionary-based de-identification methods, the data was enriched with out-of-vocabulary PHI surrogates, i.e., made up names. The data also included some PHI surrogates that were ambiguous with medical non-PHI terms. A total of seven teams participated in the challenge. Each team submitted up to three system runs, for a total of sixteen submissions. The authors used precision, recall, and F-measure to evaluate the submitted system runs based on their token-level and instance-level performance on the ground truth. The systems with the best performance scored above 98\% in F-measure for all categories of identifiers. Most out-of-vocabulary PHI could be identified accurately. However, identifying ambiguous PHI proved challenging. The performance of systems on the test data set is encouraging. Future evaluations of these systems will involve larger data sets from more heterogeneous sources.",

FHR variability was calculated using data from 30 women who had a fetal scalp electrode placed for a clinical indication, and compared to the assessment of FHR variability from four perinatologists who interpreted paper tracings of the same data. Inter-rater reliability was calculated and receiver-operator curve analysis was done. Results. Correlation between the computer algorithm's assessment of variability and the perinatologists' assessment (0.27-0.68) was similar to the inter-rater reliability between perinatologists (0.33-0.72).

Our main focus is on how to share the idle cycles of clusters and computers to execute real parallel applications. We present a new model which introduces the notions of locality and adaptability. The locality is used for job allocation, and for job migration. The adaptability provides a simple mechanism to allow clusters to join or leave a Grid. We also propose the middleware architecture to implement the model, and provide some simulation results to show the main characteristics of the model.",

However, the current schedulers do not provide automatic tools to schedule tasks to the cores. Indeed, some of them consider each core as one whole node neglecting the advantages (and disadvantages) that the spatial proximity amongst the cores could provide. In this talk, we will show some of the solutions currently being employed to tackle these scheduling problems as well as propose some of our own ideas for a model which considers the multi-core context and its impact on the scheduling algorithms.",

	abstract = "The massive use of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies is uncovering an unexpected amount of variability. The functional characterization of such variability, particularly in the most common form of variation found, the Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs), has become a priority that needs to be addressed in a systematic way. VARIANT (VARIant ANalyis Tool) reports information on the variants found that include consequence type and annotations taken from different databases and repositories (SNPs and variants from dbSNP and 1000 genomes, and disease-related variants from the Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) catalog, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) mutations, etc). VARIANT also produces a rich variety of annotations that include information on the regulatory (transcription factor or miRNA-binding sites, etc.) or structural roles, or on the selective pressures on the sites affected by the variation. This information allows extending the conventional reports beyond the coding regions and expands the knowledge on the contribution of non-coding or synonymous variants to the phenotype studied. Contrarily to other tools, VARIANT uses a remote database and operates through efficient RESTful Web Services that optimize search and transaction operations. In this way, local problems of installation, update or disk size limitations are overcome without the need of sacrifice speed (thousands of variants are processed per minute). VARIANT is available at: http://variant.bioinfo.cipf.es.",

	abstract = "The graphics processing unit (GPU) has evolved from being a fixed-function processor with programmable stages into a programmable processor with many fixed-function components that deliver massive parallelism. By modifying the GPU's stream processor to support ``general-purpose computation'' on the GPU (GPGPU), applications that perform massive vector operations can realize many orders-of-magnitude improvement in performance over a traditional processor, i.e., CPU. However, the breadth of general-purpose computation that can be efficiently supported on a GPU has largely been limited to highly dataparallel or task-parallel applications due to the lack of explicit support for communication between streaming multiprocessors (SMs) on the GPU. Such communication can occur via the global memory of a GPU, but it then requires a barrier synchronization across the SMs of the GPU in order to complete the communication between SMs. Although our previous work demonstrated that implementing barrier synchronization on the GPU itself can significantly improve performance and deliver correct results in critical bioinformatics applications, guaranteeing the correctness of inter-SM communication is only possible if a memory consistency model is assumed. To address this problem, NVIDIA recently introduced the \_threadfence() function in CUDA 2.2, a function that can guarantee the correctness of GPU-based inter-SM communication. However, this function currently introduces so much overhead that when using it in (direct) GPU synchronization, GPU synchronization actually performs worse than indirect synchronization via the CPU, thus raising the question of whether ``to GPU synchronize or not GPU synchronize?''",

Our model identifies GPU program bottlenecks and quantitatively analyzes performance, and thus allows programmers and architects to predict the benefits of potential program optimizations and architectural improvements. In particular, we use a microbenchmark-based approach to develop a throughput model for three major components of GPU execution time: the instruction pipeline, shared memory access, and global memory access. Because our model is based on the GPU's native instruction set, we can predict performance with a 5-15\% error. To demonstrate the usefulness of the model, we analyze three representative real-world and already highly-optimized programs: dense matrix multiply, tridiagonal systems solver, and sparse matrix vector multiply. The model provides us detailed quantitative analysis on performance, allowing us to understand the configuration of the fastest dense matrix multiply implementation and to optimize the tridiagonal solver and sparse matrix vector multiply by 60\% and 18\% respectively. Furthermore, our model applied to analysis on these codes allows us to suggest architectural improvements on hardware resource allocation, avoiding bank conflicts, block scheduling, and memory transaction granularity.",

@article{Gibbons1983:QRQW,
	abstract = "This paper presents results for the queue-read, queue-write asynchronous parallel random access machine (qrqw asynchronous pram) model, which is the asynchronous variant of the qrqw pram model. The qrqw pram family of models, which was introduced earlier by the authors, permit concurrent reading and writing to shared memory locations, but each memory location is viewed as having a queue which can service at most one request at a time. In the basic qrqw pram model each processor executes a series of reads to shared memory locations, a series of local computation steps, and a series of writes to shared memory locations, and then synchronizes with all other processors; thus this can be viewed as a bulk-synchronous model. In contrast, in the qrqw asynchronous pram model discussed in this paper, there is no imposed bulk-synchronization between processors, and each processor proceeds at its own pace. Thus, the qrqw asynchronous pram serves as a better model for designing and analyzing truly asynchronous parallel algorithms than the original qrqw pram. In this paper we elaborate on the qrqw asynchronous pram model, and we demonstrate the power of asynchrony over bulk-synchrony by presenting a work and time optimal deterministic algorithm on the qrqw asynchronous pram for the leader election problem and a simple randomized work and time optimal algorithm on the qrqw asynchronous pram for sorting. In contrast, no tight bounds are known on the qrqw pram for either deterministic or randomized parallel algorithms for leader election and the only work and time optimal algorithms for sorting known on the qrqw pram are those inherited from the erew pram, which are considerably more complicated. Our sorting algorithm is an asynchronous version of an earlier sorting algorithm we developed for the qrqw pram, for which we use an interesting analysis to bound the running time to be O(log n). We also present a randomized algorithm to simulate one step of a crcw pram on a qrqw asynchronous pram in sublogarithmic time if the maximum contention in the step is relatively small. © 1998---Elsevier Science B.V.

Using our model, we can evaluate asymptotic behavior of GPU algorithms more efficiently than the known models and we can develop algorithms that run fast on real GPU devices. As a showcase, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of basic existing algorithms including reduction, prefix scan, and comparison sorting. We further develop new algorithms by detecting and resolving performance bottlenecks of the existing algorithms. Our reduction algorithm has the optimal time and I/O complexities and works with non-commutative operators. Our com- parison sorting algorithm has the optimal I/O complexity. Additionally, we show our algorithms run faster than the existing algorithms not only in theory but also in practice. },

Our model, called AGPU, abstracts the essence of current GPU architectures such as global and shared memory, memory coalescing and bank conflicts. Using our model, we can evaluate asymptotic behavior of GPU algorithms more efficiently than the known models and we can develop algorithms that run fast on real GPU devices. As a showcase, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of basic existing algorithms including reduction, prefix scan, and comparison sorting. We further develop new algorithms by detecting and resolving performance bottlenecks of the existing algorithms. Our reduction algorithm has the optimal time and I/O complexities and works with non-commutative operators. Our com- parison sorting algorithm has the optimal I/O complexity. Additionally, we show our algorithms run faster than the existing algorithms not only in theory but also in practice. },

@article{Sparsh:cacheGPU,
	abstract = "Initially introduced as special-purpose accelerators for graphics applications, graphics processing units (GPUs) have now emerged as general purpose computing platforms for a wide range of applications. To address the requirements of these applications, modern GPUs include sizable hardware-managed caches. However, several factors, such as unique architecture of GPU, rise of CPU\&amp;ndash;GPU heterogeneous computing, etc., demand effective management of caches to achieve high performance and energy efficiency. Recently, several techniques have been proposed for this purpose. In this paper, we survey several architectural and system-level techniques proposed for managing and leveraging GPU caches. We also discuss the importance and challenges of cache management in GPUs. The aim of this paper is to provide the readers insights into cache management techniques for GPUs and motivate them to propose even better techniques for leveraging the full potential of caches in the GPUs of tomorrow.",
